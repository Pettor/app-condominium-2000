# Condominium 2000
Just built a condominium and feel it lacks that internets attraction we all crave? Let me present Condominium 2000!

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2015
- SQL Server express

## Legacy project
This is a legacy project made long time ago. Still the site this project was built for is still running strong with close to none maintenance. There's also a lot of quite cool implemented features like easy switch between languages for each page, Google translate for news and TwoFactor for login.

The project has been updated to MVC5 and works out of the box with VS2015.
