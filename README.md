# Condominium 2000
Just built a condominium and feel it lacks that internets attraction we all crave in modern web? Well this one is quite old but still quite cool ðŸ˜‰

A website using this template can be found at [Navet3](http://www.navet3.se).

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2015
- SQL Server express

## Features

The site is built to work great for any condominium with support for news, annual reports, contact forms, FAQ, contact information, advanced CMS that allows anyone to edit the information and much more.

The webpage also support switching between two different languages (Swedish and English as default) quick and easy. For any user adding news or information it's possible to translate between the languages using built in Google translate support. Just write the news in preferred language and translate to the other!

And there actually quite a lot more. An admin interface with secure user models, contact forms, a text editor formatting language, C# 6 features, MVC5 etc.

## Legacy project
This is actually a legacy project made long time ago. Still the site this project was built for is still running strong with close to no maintenance. There's also a lot of quite cool implemented features like easy switch between languages for each page, Google translate for news and TwoFactor for login.

The project has been updated to MVC5 and works out of the box with VS2015.
