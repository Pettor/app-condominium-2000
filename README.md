# Condominium 2000
Just built a condominium and feel it lacks that internets attraction we all crave? Let me present Condominium 2000!

A website using this template can be found at [Navet3](http://www.navet3.se).

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2015
- SQL Server express

## Features

The design smells and looks like the best of good old 2000. Repeating background and simple dots for that 2000 looking logo!

Looking to login?! Of course there is a 2000 looking button for that!

The page comes ready with language support for Swedish and English, two of the greatest languages available in the 2000.
![translate](/translate_en.png)

With one simple click of a button that sentence is now available in flawless Google translated fashion!

And there much much more of course. An admin interface with secure user models, contact forms, a text editor formatting language, C# 6 features, MVC5 etc.

## Legacy project
This is actually a legacy project made long time ago. Still the site this project was built for is still running strong with close to none maintenance. There's also a lot of quite cool implemented features like easy switch between languages for each page, Google translate for news and TwoFactor for login.

The project has been updated to MVC5 and works out of the box with VS2015.
